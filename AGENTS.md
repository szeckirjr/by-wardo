# Contributor Guide

## Dev Environment Tips
- Use Node.js version 18 (see `.nvmrc`). Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the development server with `npm run dev`.
- This is a single Next.js package so all scripts live in the root `package.json`.

## Testing Instructions
- Unit tests run with Jest and React Testing Library.
- Execute `npm test` (or `npm run test:coverage` for coverage) from the repo root.
- Lint the project with `npm run lint` before committing.
- Fix any test or type errors until the suite passes.
- Add or update tests for any code you modify.

## PR instructions
- Title format: `[by-wardo] <Title>`
